//! The interactive browser. The run loop (`run_loop`) ticks the session driver
//! (`dfdu_session::Session`), which reads the engine model under the read lock only to copy a
//! `model::snapshot::Snapshot` and the features' `model::extras::Extras`; the loop draws from
//! the copy.
//!
//! State and key handling are in `app` (with the action registry in `app::keys`), drawing in
//! `view`, with the styles in `theme` and the text for sizes, counts and bars in `format`. Each
//! feature has its own module with its state, keys and drawing: the views and panels beside the
//! list in `features`, and the overlays drawn over it in `overlay`. The state of the list's rows
//! is in `state`, the text input, the mouse and fuzzy matching in `input`, and what is read from
//! outside the UI (the engine model, the scan history and cache, the mounts outside the scan) in
//! `model`; only the duplicates comparison and the disk picker read files and disks themselves.
//! Each of these lists its modules. A scan of another path, asked for from the browser, is
//! opened in `reopen`.
//!
//! Redraws: at once on input, at most 10 times a second when the engine reports changes (at
//! once until a frame with entries has been drawn), every 100 ms while a spinner is visible, at
//! the automatic re-sort deadline, while an animation runs, and never when idle. Input is drawn
//! from the snapshot held unless it changed the directory or size mode; the model is read again
//! when scan data is due, at most 10 times a second and less often when reading takes long
//! (large directories). When only the extras are out of date (marks changed, another entry
//! selected for the details pane), they are read without copying the directory again.
