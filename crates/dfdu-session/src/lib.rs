//! What a front end shows besides drawing and input, with no terminal or window types. The
//! session driver ([`Session`], `session`) holds the engine, the state of a browser and the
//! jobs beside them, reads the model when due and carries out the actions (`act`).
//!
//! The state of a browser (`state`, [`SessionState`]) with the view shown (`view`), its marks
//! and the marks pane (`marks`) and name filter (`filter`), the directory snapshot copied out of
//! the engine model (`snapshot`), the directories tree mode expands (`tree`), the order of the
//! rows (`order`) and the fuzzy matching of what is typed (`fuzzy`). What the features read
//! from the model besides the snapshot (`extras`), and what is left to carry out after a key
//! (`effect`). From outside the UI: the scan history (`history_link`) with what grew since the
//! last scan (`growth`), the scan cache (`cache_link`), the mounts and links the scan did not
//! enter (`outside`), the selected path (`selected_path`) and the file manager that shows it
//! (`file_manager`). What is opened and how it starts (`startup`). The views: the treemap's
//! layout, depth and lower levels (`treemap`), the cleanup view (`cleanup`), the duplicates
//! comparison with its keep rules and view (`dupes`), and the largest files below a directory
//! (`largest`). The actions with their keys and labels (`actions`), the delete confirmation
//! (`confirm`), the details of an entry (`details`), the debug counters (`debug`), the list of
//! what could not be read (`error_list`), the file type filter (`type_filter`), mark by pattern
//! (`mark_pattern`), the text for numbers (`format`), the theme's tokens, built-in themes and
//! theme files (`palette`), and the single-line text input (`line`).
