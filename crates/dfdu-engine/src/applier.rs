//! The applier core: gate, chunk and close handling, pending accounting, jobs, cuts, rescans,
//! stalls, quiescence and hard links. No threads: the runtime and the simulation harness both
//! drive it. One `Applier`, its `impl` split by concern over the submodules; this module holds
//! the state, the commands and their dispatch.
