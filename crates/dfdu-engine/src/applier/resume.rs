//! The resume first walks the loaded tree a step at a time ([`Work::Resume`]): it classifies
//! it, takes it over for a job of this session and registers its hard links, and the scan
//! workers stat each directory it reaches that the journal does not name, to find what the
//! journal lost (`verify`). Until both end, nothing in the tree is deleted, rescanned or
//! cleaned. Then the changed directories are listed again by rescans that keep the loaded
//! subdirectories they find, started a few at a time (`rescans`), each putting what it kept in
//! the place of its placeholders as it swaps in (`graft`). What a cancelled resume did not list
//! again stays refused to deletes ([`Applier::unverified`]).
