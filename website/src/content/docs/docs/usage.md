description: Open a directory in dfdu, the keys, the views, mounts and the scan cache.

```sh
dfdu                      # browse the current directory
dfdu ~                    # browse a directory
dfdu --disks              # pick a disk first
dfdu --type video ~       # only video files
dfdu --remote server /srv # another host over ssh (dfdu installed there)
```

## Keys

Keys follow ncdu. Press `?` in the app for the full list.

| Key | Action | Key | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `↑↓←→` / `hjkl` | Move, open, go back | `1` `2` | List, treemap |
| `s` `n` `C` `M` | Sort by size, name, count, date | `3` | Cleanup |
| `T` | Tree mode | `4` | Duplicates |
| `/` `t` | Filter by name, by file type | `5` | Largest files |
| `v` | Mark a range | `d` | Move to Trash |
| `o` `y` | Open in file manager, copy path | `D` | Delete permanently |
| `r` | Rescan | `q` | Quit |
| `Ctrl-G` | Go to a folder | `?` | All keys |

Unreadable entries are marked `!` with the reason. Press `!` to list them all.

## Views

![The cleanup view](/demos/cleanup.gif)

The cleanup view (`3`) lists what the [cleanup rules](/docs/rules/) found, with how safe each match is to delete and how much it frees. The treemap (`2`), tree mode (`T`), duplicates (`4`) and largest files (`5`) are one key away from the list.

## Other folders

The scan starts at the folder you named, but you can leave it. At the top of the scan, `←` says so; press it again within a second or so to scan the folder above. `Ctrl-G` opens a prompt with the current folder: type a path (absolute, or relative to the current folder) and press Enter. On a scan of this computer, a path can also start with `~` for your home folder. A folder inside the scan opens at once; one outside it is scanned, with the same options. A folder inside the scan that the scan has not reached, or a mount it did not enter, keeps you where you are, and the status line says why. `Tab` completes a folder name, and Esc closes the prompt.

Clear the prompt, or leave only `/` (or a drive such as `C:` on Windows), and it lists the host's mounts with their filesystem type and how much of each is used. `↑` and `↓` pick one, and `Tab` or Enter puts it in the prompt.

After going up, the folder you came from is selected in the new scan once it appears. When the scan's folder is empty, the list says so and how to go up (`←` twice) or elsewhere (`Ctrl-G`).

The new scan starts before the old one stops, so if it cannot start you stay where you were and the status line says why. Going up from `/mnt/cache` scans `/mnt` on its own filesystem only, so the other disks mounted there are listed but not entered; press `m` on one to scan it.

On this computer, a scan of a folder above the old one keeps what the old scan read. Only the rest of the folder is listed. Each folder already read is checked by its modification time and read again if it changed. The old scan must have ended complete, with nothing being deleted or waiting to be undone. Otherwise, or when the folder's scan is in the cache, the folder is scanned as usual.

On a scan of another host (`--remote`), going up or to a folder outside the scan connects again with the new folder. dfdu gives the terminal back while it connects, so ssh can ask for a password. `Tab` asks the host for its folders and shows them when they arrive, and the mount list is the host's. The prompt does not wait for the answer: you can keep typing. A scan read from a file (`dfdu --import`) cannot leave the file: run `dfdu` with a folder instead.

## Mounts

Like `ncdu -x`, a scan stays on one filesystem. Add `--cross-mounts` for other local filesystems and `--network` for network mounts.

## The scan cache

Scans that took 3 s or more are cached, so the next `dfdu PATH` opens at once and refreshes in the background (`cached 3 h ago, refreshing` in the header). On macOS, Windows and btrfs only the changed directories are read again.

A cache is used for 14 days and the cache keeps at most 1 GiB, readable only by you. `--no-cache` scans afresh, `DFDU_CACHE=0` turns it off, `dfdu cache list` and `dfdu cache clear` manage it.

## Deleting

Deletes go to the Trash. Permanent deletes (`D`) ask you to type `delete`. `--read-only` removes the delete keys.
